### Hello World, I'm Thay  👋

- 🙋🏻‍♀️ Pronouns: She/Her
- 🔎 I'm aways learning something new
- 📚 I'm currently deepening my knowledge of TypeScript and its tools
- 💬 I love meeting new people and having interesting conversations, you can email me!
- 🌎 Fun fact: Before starting my developer career, I studied environmental engineering. So I'm very interested in Green Tech (the union of my two worlds! 💚) and creative solutions that contribute to sustainable development!

### Talk with me, I'm funny (or at least I try):
